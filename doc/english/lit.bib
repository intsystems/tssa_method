	ABSTRACT = {To solve the problem of multi-fault blind source separation (BSS) in the case that the observed signals are under-determined, a novel approach for single channel blind source separation (SCBSS) based on the improved tensor-based singular spectrum analysis (TSSA) is proposed. As the most natural representation of high-dimensional data, tensor can preserve the intrinsic structure of the data to the maximum extent. Thus, TSSA method can be employed to extract the multi-fault features from the measured single-channel vibration signal. However, SCBSS based on TSSA still has some limitations, mainly including unsatisfactory convergence of TSSA in many cases and the number of source signals is hard to accurately estimate. Therefore, the improved TSSA algorithm based on canonical decomposition and parallel factors (CANDECOMP/PARAFAC) weighted optimization, namely CP-WOPT, is proposed in this paper. CP-WOPT algorithm is applied to process the factor matrix using a first-order optimization approach instead of the original least square method in TSSA, so as to improve the convergence of this algorithm. In order to accurately estimate the number of the source signals in BSS, EMD-SVD-BIC (empirical mode decomposition—singular value decomposition—Bayesian information criterion) method, instead of the SVD in the conventional TSSA, is introduced. To validate the proposed method, we applied it to the analysis of the numerical simulation signal and the multi-fault rolling bearing signals.},

	abstract = {The precise classification of land covers with hyperspectral imagery (HSI) is a major research-focused topic in remote sensing, especially using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems as the abundant data sources have brought severe intra-class spectral variability and high spatial heterogeneity challenges, making precise classification difficult. To this end, a novel three-dimensional singular spectrum analysis (3DSSA) method is proposed for the 3D feature extraction of HSI. It aims to construct a low-rank trajectory tensor containing global and local features and extract both spectral discrimination features and spatial contextual features in conjunction with tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD). To reduce the risk of tensor operations exceeding memory on large-scale HSI data, the extended regional clustering (RC) 3DSSA framework (RC-3DSSA) is proposed for precise HSI classification. RC-3DSSA uses RC processing to alleviate the scale diversity and further applies 3DSSA to tackle issues of intra-class spectral variability and spatial heterogeneity. In order to effectively evaluate the performance of RC-3DSSA, a new challenging classification dataset namely the Qingdao UAV-borne HSI (QUH) dataset was further built. It consists of three sub-datasets: QUH-Tangdaowan, QUH-Qingyun, and QUH-Pingan, which are freely available as benchmarks for precise land cover classification. The experimental results on QUH and two publicly available datasets show that the RC-3DSSA can accurately distinguish ground objects and reliably map their distribution when benchmarked with ten state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the overall accuracies achieved are 86.62, 87.51, and 87.35 under 10 spatially disjoint training samples for the three UAV-borne HSI datasets, respectively, providing the best performance.}

Testable definitions of causality and feedback are proposed and illustrated by use of simple two-variable models. The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recording information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.},

A model’s generalization capacity will be diminished by model uncertainty with regard to input noises. However, the robustness of RNNs with respect to input noises has not been well studied yet. The localized stochastic sensitivity (LSS), which measures output disturbances with respect to input perturbations of learning models, has been successfully applied to improve the robustness of different neural networks on tabular and image data. But its effectiveness on time series data has not been explored. Therefore, we extend the idea of LSS and apply it to the robust RNNs training for time series forecasting problems. With the minimization of LSS, output sensitivities of RNNs with respect to small perturbations are reduced. So, the proposed robust RNNs will not be affected by slight input noises. We have used the LSTM as an example for theoretical analysis and analyzed the effectiveness of LSS on several RNN variants including the vanilla RNN, the gated recurrent unit (GRU), the long-short-term memory (LSTM), and the bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) in empirical studies. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of applying LSS to enhance the robustness of RNNs for time series data. For example, the robust RNNs outperform their counterpart by 53.26 and 49.45 on average in terms of Root Mean Squared Error and R-Square on five datasets.}

However, established statistical models such as exponential smoothing (ETS) and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) gain their popularity not only from their high accuracy, but also because they are suitable for non-expert users in that they are robust, efficient, and automatic. In these areas, RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, and we develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns; otherwise, we recommend a deseasonalisation step. Comparisons against ETS and ARIMA demonstrate that (semi-) automatic RNN models are not silver bullets, but they are nevertheless competitive alternatives in many situations.}

The systematic review has been done using a manual search of the published papers in the last 11 years (2006–2016) for the time series forecasting using new neural network models and the used methods are displayed. In the covered period in the study, the results obtained found 17 studies that meet all the requirements of the search criteria. Only three of the obtained proposals considered a process different to the autoregressive of a neural networks model. These results conclude that, although there are many studies that presented the application of neural network models, but few of them proposed new neural networks models for forecasting that considered theoretical support and a systematic procedure in the construction of model. This leads to the importance of formulating new models of neural networks.}

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},
