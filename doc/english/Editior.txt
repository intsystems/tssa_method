Dear Borko Furht,
We hereby submit a manuscript entitled «Tensor decomposition and forecasting for multivariate time series» by Kirll Semkin and Vadim Strijov to be considered for publication as an original article in Multimedia Tools and Applications. This paper proposes a non-parametric tensor method for the forecast and additive decomposition of interdependent multivariate time series, analyzes the optimal decomposition problem, and derives the forecast formula. The computational experiment describes the method's performance on real data and compares the method with the other models. We believe these findings will be of interest to the readers of your journal. We declare that this manuscript is original, has not been published before and is not currently being considered for publication elsewhere. We wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome. The manuscript has been read and approved by all named authors. We hope you find our manuscript suitable for publication and look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely, Semkin. K and Strijov. V
